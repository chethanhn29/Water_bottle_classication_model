# To process a dataset of zipped folders containing images of water bottles with varying water levels:

Create a new folder to store the unzipped folders in.

Unzip each of the zipped folders containing images of water bottles and place the contents into the new folder created in step 1.

When all of the zipped folders have been unzipped and the contents have been placed into the new folder, run the preprocessing script and specify the path to the new folder as the "dataset url".

The script will process the images and create a preprocessed dataset for use in training a machine learning model.

Use the preprocessed dataset to train a machine learning model to recognize the water level in images of water bottles.
