# [Water Bottle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chethuhn/water-bottle-dataset)

## Overview
This dataset contains a collection of images of water bottles with varying water levels. The images are divided into three categories: Full water level, Half water level, and Overflowing. Each category contains a number of images of water bottles with the corresponding water level.

The purpose of the dataset is to be used for an image classification problem, where a machine learning model is trained to classify the water level of a given water bottle image. The dataset is intended to be used for training and testing a machine learning model for image classification.

## Dataset Description
The dataset consists of a number of water bottle images, each of which has been classified based on the water level inside the bottle. The images in the Full water level category show water bottles with the maximum possible amount of water inside, while the images in the Half water level category show water bottles with roughly half the maximum amount of water inside. The images in the Overflowing category show water bottles with more water inside than the maximum capacity of the bottle, resulting in water spilling out.

## Potential Applications
There are several potential applications for this dataset. It may be useful for developing automated systems for monitoring and managing water levels in containers, or for use in a general image classification problem. The dataset may also be useful for research purposes, as it allows for the development and testing of machine learning models for image classification tasks.

## Using the Dataset
To process the dataset of images of water bottles with varying water levels:

1.  Download the zipped folders containing images of water bottles from the link provided (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chethuhn/water-bottle-dataset).
2.  Create a new folder to store the unzipped folders in.
3.  Unzip each of the zipped folders containing images of water bottles and place the contents into the new folder created in step 2.
4. When all of the zipped folders have been unzipped and the contents have been placed into the new folder, run the preprocessing script and specify the path to the new folder as the "dataset url" in the code.
5. The script will process the images and create a preprocessed dataset for use in training a machine learning model.
6. Use the preprocessed dataset to train a machine learning model to recognize the water level in images of water bottles.
