# Water Bottle Classication Using CNN
## Objective: image classification model to classify water bottles as Full,Half,Overflowing Water bottles based on water level inside

### 1.Collect a labeled dataset of images of water bottles, with each image labeled with the corresponding water level (full, half, or overflowing).
### 2.Preprocess the images as needed, such as by resizing or cropping them.
### 3.Use data augmentation techniques to increase the size of the dataset and improve model generalization.
### 4.Convert the images to a size of 256x256 and ensure that they have 3 channels (RGB).
### 5.Split the dataset into training and validation sets.
### 6.Implement a CNN using TensorFlow and Keras.
### 7.Use the Adam optimizer and a batch size of 32 to train the model on the training set.
### 8.Use class weights to address imbalanced classes in the dataset.
### 9.Monitor the model's performance on the validation set during training.
### 10.Calculate performance metrics such as precision, recall, validation loss, and accuracy loss.
### 11.Deploy the model using Gradio for real-time classification.
### 12.Use the trained model to classify new images of water bottles and predict the water level inside.
